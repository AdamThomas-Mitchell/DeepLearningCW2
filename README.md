Code for Deep Learning coursework 2. The code takes bitcoin price data and trains a LSTM neural network to forecast future prices given previous price data. 

Currently, when the code runs the final model will be trained and tested on the test set. If test functions within the main block are uncommented the programme will build and test models with different hyperparamter values on the validation set.
